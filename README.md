# ObjectOrientedProgramming-Game-Show-App
Project 4 of Techdegree

A game application where the user guesses a word


Changed the css of background of buttons when you guess wrong and right to more accurately reflect the status.
Changed border-radius of the overlay to 0px to prevent the weird rounded corners..
Kinda fixed a dark mode by darkening body background color, wrong color, right color, neutral color.
Added shadow to the buttons and extra shadow when button is active.
Removed the shadow on buttons for .chosen and .wrong to indicate that they can no longer be pressed.
Changed color of the title and added a shadow.
